## Using Composer
If you are using composer to manage Drupal modules, make sure you add custom
location for this module to be downloaded to. You must add the installer types
line as well as the location for the module.

```json
  ...
  "installer-types": ["custom-drupal-module"],
  "installer-paths": {
    "web/core": ["type:drupal-core"],
    "web/modules/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-module"],
    "web/modules/custom/{$name}": ["type:custom-drupal-module"],
    "web/profiles/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-profile"],
    "web/themes/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-theme"],
    "drush/contrib/{$name}": ["type:drupal-drush"]
  },
  ...
```
